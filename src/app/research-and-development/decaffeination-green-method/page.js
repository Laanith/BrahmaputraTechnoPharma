  Green decaffeination methods focus on removing caffeine from coffee beans and tea leaves using environmentally friendly processes that maintain flavor and quality.
</li>

<li>
  One popular green method is the Swiss Water Process, which uses only water to extract caffeine, relying on solubility and osmosis without the need for chemical solvents.
</li>

<li>
  Another method involves using supercritical carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚), which acts as a solvent at high pressures to selectively extract caffeine while preserving other flavor compounds.
</li>

<li>
  These methods ensure that the decaffeination process is sustainable, reducing chemical waste and minimizing environmental impact compared to traditional solvent-based techniques.
</li>

<li>
  The resulting decaffeinated products are tested for flavor and caffeine content to ensure they meet quality standards, providing a healthier and eco-friendly option for consumers.
